# PicoClaw Railway Template (1-click deploy)

This repo packages **PicoClaw** for Railway with a web-based configuration UI and gateway management dashboard.

## What you get

- **PicoClaw Gateway** managed as a subprocess with auto-restart
- A web **Configuration UI** at `/` (protected by Basic Auth) for editing providers, channels, agent defaults, and tools
- A **Status Dashboard** with live gateway state, provider/channel status, cron jobs, and real-time logs
- Persistent state via **Railway Volume** (config, workspace, sessions, and cron survive redeploys)

## How it works

- The container builds PicoClaw from source and runs a small Go web server alongside it
- The Go web server provides a configuration editor that reads/writes `~/.picoclaw/config.json` directly
- On startup, if any provider API key is configured, the gateway starts automatically
- The gateway subprocess output is captured into a 500-line log buffer viewable from the Status tab

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Username for Basic Auth |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | Password for Basic Auth. **Check deploy logs for the generated password if not set.** |
| `PICOCLAW_VERSION` | `main` | Git branch/tag to build PicoClaw from |

## FAQ

**Q: How do I access the configuration page?**

A: Go to your deployed instance's URL. When prompted for credentials, use `admin` as the username and the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from your Railway Variables as the password.

**Q: Where do I find the auto-generated password?**

A: Check the deploy logs in Railway. The password is printed at startup: `Generated admin password: ...`

**Q: How do I change the AI model?**

A: Go to the Configuration tab → Agent Defaults → Model field. Set it to `provider/model-name` format (e.g., `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`, `openai/gpt-4.1`).

**Q: The gateway isn't starting. What should I check?**

A: Make sure at least one provider has an API key configured. The gateway auto-starts only when an API key is present. You can also manually start it from the Status tab.
